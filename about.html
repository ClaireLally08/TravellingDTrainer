        <h1 class="title">About the Travelling Dog Trainer</h1>
        <div class="main-par">
          <p class="start about-me">Unlike other professions, dog training is unregulated. When looking for an expert to 
          entrust with your dogs’ needs, it is important to research both their skills and knowledge. With the myriad 
          of different organisations and the plethora of courses to become a dog trainer, choosing the right person can be a minefield for
           the pet owner. When working particularly with dogs who have an aggressive nature, those calling themselves “Behaviourists” should have a relevant 
            degree in Animal Behaviour. Animal Behaviour and learning theory is a science. Punitive and aversive training methods, using fear and force, will exacerbate problems.
            Claire's aim with the Travelling Dog Trainer is to help owners build a relationship with their dog based on trust. 
            She can teach you the skills and give you an understanding of how dogs learn and what motivates your pooches behaviour.</p>
          <p class="about-me">Established in 2018, the idea came to Claire whilst travelling across the Wild Atlantic Way with her collie puppy, Cass, who now is her trusty sidekick. 
          After realising the need for dog trainers in the counties outside of Dublin. Claire held her first class in Buncrana, Co.Donegal only a few days later on the 20th June 2018. </p>
          <p class="about-me">Claire is both a behaviourist and dog trainer. Claire grew up with a love of all animals. After leaving school Claire attended University College 
          Dublin to study Zoology. Following her honours degree she was accepted into Queens University Belfast and graduated with a Masters in Animal Welfare and Behaviour.</p>
          <p class="end about-me">Throughout her studies, Claire worked for the Dublin SPCA.  Claire left to pursue her love of dog behaviour and training incorporated with the passion for travel, and so The Travelling Trainer was created.</p>
