          <h1 class="title">About the Travelling Dog Trainer</h1>
          <p class="ptA about-me">Unlike other professions, dog training is unregulated. When looking for an expert to entrust with your dogs’ needs, it is important to research both their skills and knowledge. With the myriad of different organisations and the plethora of courses to become a dog trainer, choosing the right person can be a minefield for the pet owner.
            When working particularly with dogs who have an aggressive nature, those calling themselves “Behaviourists” should have a relevant degree in Animal Behaviour.
            Animal Behaviour and learning theory is a science. Punitive and aversive training methods, using fear and force, will exacerbate problems.
            Claire's aim with the Travelling Dog Trainer is to help owners build a relationship with their dog based on trust. She can teach you the skills and give you an understanding of how dogs learn and what motivates your pooches behaviour.</p>
          <p class="ptB about-me">Established in 2018, the idea came to Claire whilst travelling across the Wild Atlantic Way with her collie puppy, Cass. After realising the need for dog trainers in the counties outside of Dublin. Claire held her first class in Buncrana, Co.Donegal only a few days later on the 20th June 2018. </p>
          <p class="ptC about-me">Claire is an expert dog behaviourist and dog trainer. Claire grew up with a love of all animals. After leaving school Claire attended University College Dublin to study Zoology. Following her honours degree she was accepted into Edinburgh University to study at the Royal Dick School of Veterinary and graduated with Masters in Applied Animal Welfare and Behaviour.</p>
          <p class="ptD about-me">On returning to Ireland Claire began working for the Dublin SPCA while continuing her education in the area of dog training and behaviour. Following on from that Claire began employment with the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind as a supervisor in Dublin and in 2010 qualified as a puppy trainer for Guide Dogs worldwide. Claire left to pursue her love of dog behaviour and training incorporated with the passion for travel, and so The Travelling Trainer was created.</p>
