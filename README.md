# Travelling Dog Trainer

This is a website I created to promote a (fictious) dog training business.  The Travelling Dog Trainer (TDT) business focus is to educate owners on responsible dog ownership. 

Finding a dog trainer in Ireland really is not an easy task.  There's next to no qualifications required to become a trainer, and often there are more horror stories than good when it comes to hiring a trainer. 

Taking a special focus on the areas outside of Dublin, and specifically, rural Ireland. The TDT's aim is to educate dog owners by teaching and practicing positive-reinforcement training methods.
