# Travelling Dog Trainer

This is a website I created to promote a (fictious) dog training business.  The Travelling Dog Trainer (TDT) business focus is to educate owners on responsible dog ownership. 

Finding a dog trainer in Ireland really is not an easy task.  There's next to no qualifications required to become a trainer, and often there are more horror stories than good when it comes to hiring a trainer. 

Taking a special focus on the areas outside of Dublin, and specifically, rural Ireland. The TDT's aim is to educate dog owners by teaching and practicing positive-reinforcement training methods.

UX

The Navigation bar is always visible when you are on the site, allowing for easy navigation to any part, no matter where you are within the site.

The home button and logo will take you right back to the landing page where you can get your bearings and start your journey over again.

The About section introduces vistors to the TDT, Claire and also discusses briefly some of the concerns surrounding dog training in Ireland. 

The Services section clearly discusses the services offered and the length of each session.  

In the contact page there are ways for users to get in touch with the TDT and request classes in their own local area. 

In the footer, there are links to all their social media, so you can connect with them more..
